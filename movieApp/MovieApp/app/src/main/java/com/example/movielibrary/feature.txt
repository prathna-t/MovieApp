For week 12's lab, I implemented a new feature - log in and sign up.

- When a user signs up, their email and password will be saved in the database. However, if there is a duplicate sign
up, a toast "User already exist" appears.

-When the user tries to log in, the username and password has to match the database. If the email doesn't match, users
will get notified. If the password doesn't match, users will get notified that password is wrong.If both match the database,
log in will be successful, and it will jump to the movie library activity.
